    .v1{
        border-left: 4px solid rgb(120,121,123);

<body>
    <b>This will be your heading</b>
    
        <p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read, in the middle of the text you want to highlight a <strong>strong statement that will blow everybody's mind </strong>using bold text. Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
 
        <div class="v1">
            <blockquote><p><i>A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble   of thinking for 
                oneself, always a laborious business.<br>
                <strong> â€• A.A. Milne, If I May</strong></i></p></blockquote>
        </div>
 
        
  Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:
  <ol>
    <li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
    <li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
    <li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
<ol>
      
</body>
